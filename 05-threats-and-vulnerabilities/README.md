# ⚠️ Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

This folder contains my work and notes from **Course 5** of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focused on risk identification and vulnerability analysis.

---

## ✅ What I Practiced

### 🔹 Key Concepts Covered
- The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
- Asset classification and risk levels
- Types of threat actors (insiders, outsiders, hacktivists, etc.)
- Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)

### 🔹 Practical Activities
- Analyzed real-world security breaches and mapped them to threats/vulnerabilities
- Completed a simulated vulnerability scan in lab environment
- Used checklists and frameworks to assess asset security

## 🧠 Reflections
This course helped me understand how simple misconfigurations or outdated software can expose even the most secure-looking systems. Learning how to classify risks and prioritize them has shifted how I think about cybersecurity in real life.

## 🔧 Tools & Methods Used
- Simulated vulnerability scanner (via Coursera lab)
- Threat modeling worksheets
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (reference only)
