# 🛠️ Tools of the Trade: Linux & SQL

This folder contains my hands-on work and practice from **Course 4** of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. It focuses on two essential tools: the **Linux command line** and **SQL** for querying data.

## ✅ What I Practiced

### 🔹 Linux Command Line
- Navigating the filesystem using `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`
- Managing files and directories: `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `nano`
- Viewing content: `cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, `tail`
- Working with permissions: `chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`
- Using wildcards and filters: `grep`, `find`, `wc`

### 🔹 SQL Basics
- Retrieving data: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Filtering with `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`
- Sorting and limiting results: `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Counting and aggregating: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`
- Joining tables: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`

## 🧠 Reflections
Understanding the Linux CLI was empowering — I now see why it’s essential in security operations. SQL helped me think like a data analyst, which is critical when hunting through logs or alerts in a SIEM system.
